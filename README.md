Flask-RESTful is the extension for Flask that contains functions and support you’ll use to develop REST APIs. Python developers will enjoy the ease and speed of a minimal set up before moving on to explore Flask-RESTful’s built-in template library. Using templates as a jumping off point during development is a great way to quickly and easily develop REST APIs, and it has the additional benefit of guiding you to consistently follow API development best practices.

In this course, you'll learn to set up your environment to build a RESTful API server. You'll install the Flask-RESTful libraries on Windows and macOS and you’ll also work with the CURL command-line utility to make API calls.

Next you'll implement a simple API server that responds to HTTP GET requests and then how to configure responses for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

Moving on, you'll configure your API server to accept parameters as part of the URL path and send data to your server using the request body in POST requests.

Upon finishing this course, you'll be able to configure a simple API server using Flask-RESTful to respond to your HTTP requests.
